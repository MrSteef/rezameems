A satirical website for a friend who is being portrayed as the party leader of several dutch political parties.
His alias is 'Reza Meems'.

The website includes an overview of parties he represents.
The site also has a page where users can answer a few questions to help them decide which party they should vote on, however the questions are not at all serious, and it will always lead back to Reza Meems, but just representing a different party.
There are many more possible questions that one will have to answer, so users can do the quiz multiple times and keep getting more new content.
